Data captured from initial graph, State-Code has been extended with full State name

Things I would like to improve compared to the original visualization:
* Overlapping bubble difficult to understand - use a simple bar chart instead
* Abbreviations in region names - use full state name instead
* Numbers with varying decimal places - just show rounded percentages
* not all numbers sum up too 100% (change GJ Non Veggies from 39.45 to 39.05) - data to be corrected

What I could not (yet) do:
* Assign data to a map (still need to learn more about dimple.js, d3.js, and DataMaps: http://datamaps.github.io/)
* In the end I would like to color the different states of India according to the percentage of vegetarians (color scale from green to red), 
  so that I can visualize the north west to east change from vegetarians to non-vegetarians in a simple manner.
